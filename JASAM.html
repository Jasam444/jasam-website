    <b>Introdction</b><p>Chemistry is a branch of natural science which has helped individuals all over the world in terms of 
        drug production, fertilizers and other chemicals. Chemistry also involves the study of certain substances and why they 
      behave as such. Chemistry is made up of both macroscopic(where we can see and measure substances) and microscopic(where
      they are very small detail of substances). These macroscopic and microscopic substances come together and it is called matter.
      Sometimes I say chemistry is playing a huge role in the survival of man.This is because when we fall sick we can die but because
      of the production of drugs, we are still alive.</p><p><a href="JASAM2.html" target="_blank" class="yes"><b>Definition, Branches and Importance of chemistry</b></a></p>

<p>Also we know food gives humans energy to do certain things so without food we will grow weaker and weaker but through the introduction
    of chemicals through chemistry, we have been able to produce fertilizers which has made growing crops very easy and now we can
    consume food which will make us energetic and work efficiently. So you can imagine the number of lifes that can be saved if we had 
    lots of chemists, doctors and other people who study chemistry in our country to produce items to satisfy the need of man
    and the nation. Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds. The development of electrochemical
    theory of chemical combination happened in the early 19th century by two scientists called Jons Jacob Berzelius and
    Humphery Davy.

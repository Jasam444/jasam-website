    <p>Chemistry is a scientific discipline that focuses on the study of matter and the changes it undergoes. It is also the composition
        and structure of matter.Chemistry is also refered to as central scince because it links Biology, Physics ,Environmental
        science and engineering. Chemistry is not only important for biology and physics areas but also in technology,
        agriculture and ecology areas. The word chemistry is from the word<b>"Alchemy"</b>which means <b>of metals.</b> Alchemy came
        from <b>alchem</b> which means <b>country of dark soil</b> and it is the ancient name of Egypt.

    <p>There are two main branches of chemistry.</p> <p><b>i) Pure chemistry.</b></p> <p>This is a branch of chemistry that
        deals with the attempt to getting the better understanding of nature.This branch of chemistry does not involve practical
        use or application but it studies the basic theories and knowledge of chemistry.It also involves exploring the properties,
        structure and behaviour of matter at the molecular and atomic level, discovery of compounds and improving technologies to make life
        easier and better for us.There are three(3) maim branches of pure chemistry. 
    </p>
    <p><b>a) Physical</b></p> <p>This branch of pure chemistry combines the principles from chemistry and physics to study the structure
        of matter and their physical properties.
    </p> <b>b)Inorganic</b> <P>It studies non-carbon base compounds, elements, properties and reaction. It excludes carbon compounds but includes
        trioxocarbonates, carbon(IV) oxide and carbon(II) oxide.

    </P>
    <p><b>c) Organic</b></p> <P>It studies carbon base compounds their properties and behaviour.It focuses on the stucture and reactions
    of organic compounds.
    </P> <p><b>ii) Applied chemistry</b></p> <p>It is a branch of chemistry that uses the knowledge of chemistry to produce goods and
        other services for mankind.This branch of chemistry focuses only on the practical application of chemistry in various fields like
        biochemistry, medicine, pharmacy etc.

<p>Chemistry has helped in the agricultural sector by the maximizing of crop yield and minimizing of cost products. It helps in agriculture through the development 
    of fertilizers, chemical pesticides and many more.

<p>Chemistry has improved food preservation.It helps us to understand and practice the composition of different ingrdients to create different variety
    of food and also use chemicals as preservatives to preserve the food for later. <p><b><a class="nice">Transportation</a></b></p>

<p>During fuel production, chemicals are put together to produce the fuel. These fuels are used to fill vehicles which are used to transport humans
    beings and loads from one place to the other.
